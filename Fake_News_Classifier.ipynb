Sarah Palin defended recent claims by Donald Trump that the election could be rigged.\\n\\n\\\"Of course he gets crucified by the press saying he's conspiratorial or something, saying there could be voter fraud,\\\" she said. \\\"Well, primaries can be fixed, and debate questions can be fixed, and dead people can vote.\\\"\\n\\n \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\n\\n In 2012, about 780 monitors were dispatched.

It came several months after the same court had denied an emergency stay request from the Justice Department.\\n\\nThe decision means that one of Obama\\u2019s signature immigration initiatives remains on hold nearly a year after he announced it through executive action and leaves in doubt whether the program will begin before his term expires in January 2017. Republican presidential candidates have pledged to dismantle the program, creating additional urgency within the Obama administration to get it started.\\n\\n\\u201cThe president must follow the rule of law, just like everybody else,\\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement Monday. Texas led a coalition of 26 states that brought the lawsuit. \\u201cThroughout this process, the Obama Administration has aggressively disregarded the constitutional limits on executive power.\\u201d\\n\\nImmigration advocates, who feared time was running out to get the case before the high court next year, called on the administration to appeal quickly and maintained confidence that the Supreme Court would issue a favorable ruling by next June.\\n\\n\\u201cEvery single day that goes by means further delays,\\u201d said Marielena Hincapi\\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, who has closely followed the case. \\u201cOnce the green light is given [by the Supreme Court], it will make it that much more difficult for any administration, Republican or Democrat, to undo the program.\\u201d\\n\\nA White House official said the administration strongly disagreed with the court decision and was reviewing its legal options.\\n\\n\\u201cThis lawsuit is preventing people who have been part of our communities for years from working on the books, contributing to our economy by paying taxes on that work, and being held accountable,\\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.\\n\\nThere are an estimated 11\\u00a0million immigrants living in the country illegally. After House Republicans blocked a comprehensive immigration bill last year, Obama announced plans to use executive action to dramatically expand a 2012 program that deferred the deportations of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children. Under the new program, the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens would be eligible to remain and apply for three-year work permits, provided they had not committed other crimes and lived in the country at least five years.\\n\\nBut 26 states, most with Republican governors, sued to block the program, arguing they would incur fees associated with the issuance of driver\\u2019s licenses to the immigrants and asserting the Obama administration had failed to abide by federal rulemaking requirements. In February, a U.S. District Court judge in Brownsville, Tex., ruled that the program could not get underway as he continued to review whether the program was constitutional, stopping it just days before the Department of Homeland Security was to begin accepting applications.\\n\\nThe 5th Circuit panel that ruled Monday included two judges \\u2014 Jerry Smith and Jennifer Elrod, both appointed by Republican presidents \\u2014 who had ruled against the administration\\u2019s stay request in May and maintained their stances. A third judge, Carolyn Dineen King, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, was not on the earlier panel, and she dissented Monday, ruling in favor of the Obama administration.\\n\\nIn a 135-page decision, Smith wrote that District Judge Andrew Hanen\\u2019s decision in February to issue an injunction on Obama\\u2019s program was \\u201cimpressive and thorough.\\u201d The appeals court dismissed the administration\\u2019s argument that Texas lacked legal standing to challenge a federal immigration program.\\n\\n\\u201cToday\\u2019s ruling is a slap in the face to the good people in America who have also been waiting for Congress and the courts to act with justice, humanity and common sense on the issue of immigration reform,\\u201d said Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
